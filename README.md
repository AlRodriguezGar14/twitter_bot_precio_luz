This is a Twitter bot that updates every hour with the current and next hourâ€™s price of the light in Spain. 

It also makes a comparison with the price three years ago, tells the cheapest and most expensive hours, and calculates how much the light will cost monthly with the average price of today.

The price is PVPC and adjusted to the average family consumption.

The bot is running on an AWS server with US timezone. That's why the hours are adjusted to match the timezone of Spain.
